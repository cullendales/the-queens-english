# The Queen's English

## About
This program allows users to write any program with Canadian spelling and then converts the necessary words to change (ie. colour to color) while running the program or uploading to GitHub without changing it in the users computer. For Canadian and most English speakers, this allows you to write English your natural way and not have to bother with the Amaricanized spelling.

## Roadmap
- [x] Finish initial program which converts spelling using regex
- [ ] Write program which can run in background and calls the conversion program
