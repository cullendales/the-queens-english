## About
This program allows users to write programs in Python, HTML, & CSS using Canadian spelling and then converts the necessary words to change (ie. colour to color) while running the program without changing it on the user's side. For Canadian and most English speakers, this allows you to write English your natural way.

## Usage
1. Clone repository onto your local machine
2. Add queen.py into the directory of the program you plan to run
3. Run program using form: Python3 queen.py yourProgramHere

## Roadmap - Complete
- [x] Finish initial program which converts spelling using regex
- [x] Finish Python version which converts spelling when run while maintaining Canadian spelling
- [x] Create CSS, HTML version

## Sample
### Running using Python and KNeighborsClassifier

In the example above, there are three instances of Canadian English - two of which would normally cause an error. One usage of the Queen's English is in the import statement for KNeighborsClassifier, another when instantiating the KNeighborsClassifier class, and the final one the usage of colour (which wouldn't cause an error here but would in a CSS file).

When  queen.py is run along with the test program, the English is changed temporarily to run but remains the same in the original test.py file.
